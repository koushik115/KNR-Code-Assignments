# K&R Code Assignments
Welcome to the K&R Code Assignments repository! This repository is dedicated to those learning C programming through "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced learner, these assignments will guide you through the fundamental concepts of C as presented in the seminal book.

About The Repository
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a chapter or specific concept from K&R's book. Inside, you will find solutions to selected exercises along with detailed explanations that not only show how to solve the problem but also why certain solutions are preferred in a C programming context.
